# tennis-score

Thanks to [Markus Oliver Annuk](https://github.com/markusoliverannuk) we have tennis table at kood/JÃµhvi school.

And there is score counting device that I've crafted.

Check [photo](https://github.com/AlexDubtsov/tennis-score/blob/main/20240319_093558.jpg) of it.

## How to use it

Here are instructions for my score calculating device, based on the Arduino platform.

- Plug the USB wire into any 5V power source.

The greetings screen will appear.

- Press any button.

The "Start New Game" menu will now appear on the screen.

- Press the L or R button depending on whose turn it is first in this game.

If either player gets a score:

- Press the corresponding L or R button once.

The score counter will display on the LCD screen.

LEDs on the sides of the box will indicate whose turn it is now.

If the L or R LED blinks, that means it's the player's first turn now.

If the L or R LED is continuously on, that means it's the second turn.

Both LEDs blinking means the game is over. Check scores on the screen.

- Long press on both buttons starts a new game.

- Short press on both buttons cancels the last score change.

You can cancel up to 20 last changes.
